/**
 * This package provides TypeScript definitions for the types of the REST API requests and responses on the GoodData platform.
 * It also provides functions that operate on those objects directly.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This is a companion package of `@gooddata/api-client-bear` that implements the actual client and uses
 * the types and functions implemented here. You should almost never need to use this package directly.
